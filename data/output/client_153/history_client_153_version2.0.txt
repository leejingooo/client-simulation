Jane, a 29-year-old single female, works as a software engineer. Over the past few months, she has experienced episodes of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, and occasional hallucinations, particularly under work-related stress. Despite her energetic and euphoric demeanor, Jane acknowledges seeing things others don’t, which adds to her distress.

Jane's psychiatric history reveals a turbulent journey. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at 25, she battled moderate symptoms for two years. At 27, her condition escalated to Bipolar I Disorder, marked by severe mood swings and requiring both outpatient medication and inpatient electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). While medication was partially effective, it led to weight gain. ECT proved more beneficial but caused memory loss.

Her upbringing in a stable yet strict home, alongside her mother’s struggle with Major Depressive Disorder and her father's alcohol use disorder, shaped her early life. Academically, Jane faced challenges, but she maintained a few close friendships. Professionally, she excels as a software engineer, though recent mood fluctuations have strained her relationship with her supervisor.

Currently living alone, Jane’s mental status examination highlights a labile affect and grandiose thought content, with occasional auditory hallucinations. Although she is alert and oriented, her insight remains partial, often attributing her symptoms to external events. Despite her challenges, Jane’s reliability and social judgment remain intact.
