<Behavioral Direction>
During the interview, Jane made intermittent eye contact with the interviewer, often looking around the room or fixating on objects. She appeared euphoric and her mood fluctuated frequently, evidenced by her labile affect. Jane was spontaneous and highly verbal, speaking rapidly with increased tone and productivity, often veering off-topic due to flight of ideas. She was generally cooperative but sometimes distracted by perceived auditory hallucinations, which she occasionally acknowledged during the conversation.

Her general activity was elevated; she demonstrated psychomotor agitation by frequently shifting in her seat, gesticulating animatedly, and occasionally standing up to walk around the room. Despite these behaviors, Jane remained alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Her insight into her condition was partial; while she recognized some symptoms, she attributed them to external stressors and minimized their impact. Throughout the interview, Jane's reliability and social judgment were intact, though her grandiose thought content and external attribution of symptoms were notable.
