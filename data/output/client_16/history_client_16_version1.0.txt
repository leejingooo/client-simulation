**History:**

Ji-woo, a 24-year-old university student from Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with the shadows of her mind since mid-2022. Born and raised in Seoul, she grew up in a small family with an older brother, under the watchful eye of a mother who herself battled depression. Despite no significant medical or neurological history, Ji-woo's life took a turn when she began experiencing a persistent depressed mood, insomnia, and a loss of interest in daily activities, all surfacing around June 2022. 

Her academic life, once a sanctuary of learning and growth, now feels like an insurmountable mountain. Her evenings are no longer filled with the joy of hobbies or social interactions but are instead haunted by sleepless nights. The occasional drink with friends offers fleeting relief, yet her overall social interactions have waned. Ji-woo's well-groomed appearance and casual attire mask the internal struggle she faces daily. She often appears withdrawn, making minimal eye contact, her psychomotor activity noticeably slowed.

During her mental status examination, Ji-woo was cooperative but reserved, her speech soft and slow. Her mood was unmistakably depressed, her affect flat. Her thought processes were sluggish, and she frequently expressed feelings of hopelessness and guilt. Despite this, she has no suicidal ideation. Her perception remained intact, with no hallucinations or illusions, but her insight into her condition was limited.

Ji-woo's psychodynamic formulation reveals deep-seated defense mechanisms, including repression and denial. Her attachment style leans towards insecure and fearful-avoidant, possibly stemming from her mother's mental health struggles. Ji-woo's journey is a poignant reminder of the silent battles many face, hidden behind well-groomed appearances and casual conversations.
