Minji Lee, a 24-year-old software engineer from Seoul, South Korea, has recently been grappling with a significant decline in her mental well-being. Born and raised in Seoul, Minji grew up in a relatively stable household with her parents and an older brother. While her family environment was supportive, her father battled depression, and her mother struggled with anxiety, casting a long shadow over her formative years.

Minji has always been a high achiever, excelling academically and professionally. However, since the beginning of 2023, she has been experiencing a pervasive depressed mood, which has progressively worsened over the past year. Initially, she could manage her symptoms, but by December 2023, her condition had deteriorated significantly. This was accompanied by persistent insomnia from March and a growing disinterest in activities she once enjoyed, starting around May.

Despite the absence of any significant medical or neurological conditions, Minji's struggle with these symptoms has been compounded by her occasional reliance on over-the-counter sleep aids. Socially, she maintains a non-smoking lifestyle and consumes alcohol occasionally. Her well-groomed appearance belies the inner turmoil she faces; she appears tired and maintains limited eye contact, indicating her profound fatigue and psychological distress.

During her mental status examination, Minji presented as soft-spoken, with a slow rate of speech. Her mood was unmistakably depressed, and her affect was notably restricted. Her thought processes remained linear and goal-directed, yet she was preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness. Despite this, she did not exhibit any hallucinations or illusions, and her insight into her condition was partial.

Psychodynamically, Minji employs defense mechanisms such as repression and intellectualization, likely as coping strategies developed during her childhood. Her attachment style is characterized by insecurity and avoidance, possibly stemming from her parents' mental health struggles.

Minji's journey is a poignant reminder of the complex interplay between genetic predispositions, personal history, and the pressures of modern life, all of which have culminated in her current mental health challenges.
