During the interview, Mary made inconsistent eye contact, often looking away or staring into the distance as if listening to something unseen. Her demeanor was mostly submissive and cooperative, though she frequently appeared distracted and had difficulty maintaining focus on the questions asked. Maryâ€™s verbal responses were generally spontaneous and moderately productive, but she occasionally provided tangential answers, reflecting her ongoing auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusions. While she showed respect and a willingness to engage, her dysphoric mood and blunt affect were evident through her subdued tone of voice and lack of emotional expression.

Mary's general activity level appeared normal, with no significant increase or decrease observed. She remained seated throughout the interview, displaying no signs of psychomotor agitation or retardation. Despite her internal struggles, Mary demonstrated intellectual insight into her condition and maintained a level of reliability in her responses, though her concentration and cognitive processing showed some impairment, particularly during tasks requiring sustained attention or complex thinking.
