**History:**

Jin-ah, a 24-year-old graduate student residing in Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with significant emotional and psychological challenges for several years. Born and raised in Seoul, Jin-ah's family consisted of her parents and a younger brother. Her mother, who also battled depression, may have influenced Jin-ah’s own struggles with mental health, while her father’s hypertension added a layer of medical concern within the family.

Jin-ah's journey with depression began in early 2021. Initially, she felt a pervasive sadness that she thought would pass. Instead, it deepened, leading her to experience a persistently depressed mood that has lingered for over three years. By mid-2022, insomnia compounded her difficulties, making it hard for her to find rest and further eroding her well-being.

Academically successful, Jin-ah pursued her studies with determination, yet her emotional struggles began to take a toll on her. Despite being on antidepressants since 2023, the sense of worthlessness and hopelessness persisted, making daily activities feel insurmountable. Her social life also suffered; although she occasionally consumed alcohol, she refrained from smoking, perhaps in an attempt to maintain some semblance of control over her health.

Jin-ah's appearance often reflected her inner turmoil. While she managed to dress neatly, her slightly disheveled hair and withdrawn demeanor were telltale signs of her ongoing battle. Her interactions were marked by slow, soft, and hesitant speech, and she avoided eye contact, which spoke volumes about her internal state. Despite this, she remained cooperative, though reserved, during examinations.

Her mental state revealed a deeply blunted affect and a slow, deliberate thought process dominated by themes of worthlessness and hopelessness. Though she did not experience hallucinations or illusions, she had partial insight into her condition, recognizing her struggles but feeling trapped by them. The presence of suicidal ideation was a concerning aspect of her mental health.

Jin-ah's psychological defenses, including repression and denial, likely stemmed from her anxious-preoccupied attachment style and difficulty trusting others. These dynamics, coupled with her family history and personal experiences, painted a complex picture of a young woman striving to navigate the interplay of her academic ambitions and her profound emotional challenges.
