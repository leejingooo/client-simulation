**History:**

Eun-Ji was born in Seoul, South Korea, but moved to Busan at the age of 10 when her father got a job as an engineer in the bustling port city. Growing up, she idolized her older brother, who was a constant source of support and encouragement. Her mother, however, struggled with bouts of depression, which often cast a shadow over their household. Despite this, Eun-Ji excelled academically and eventually pursued a graduate degree in marine biology, a field she felt passionate about.

In May 2022, Eun-Ji first noticed a persistent sense of sadness and fatigue that she couldn't shake off. She attributed it to academic stress and the recent breakup with her long-term boyfriend. As time passed, the feelings deepened, leading her to withdraw from her social circle and lose interest in her studies. By March 2023, her nights were plagued by insomnia, leaving her exhausted and unable to focus during the day. In June, her doctor prescribed Fluoxetine, but the medication offered limited relief.

Living alone in a small apartment near her university, Eun-Ji tried to maintain a fa√ßade of normalcy. She occasionally met friends for drinks and kept up with her coursework, but internally, she felt increasingly hopeless and worthless. Her mother's struggle with depression loomed large in her mind, making her fear that she might never escape the same fate.

When she finally sought psychiatric help in January 2024, she was well-groomed but noticeably reserved. Her speech was soft and slow, her mood evidently depressed, and her affect blunted. She exhibited psychomotor retardation and spoke of thoughts filled with hopelessness. Though cooperative, she was cautious, partially aware of her condition but unable to fully grasp its severity. Her defense mechanisms of denial and suppression, coupled with her insecure and fearful-avoidant attachment styles, added layers of complexity to her mental state. The presence of suicidal ideation was a stark reminder of the urgency of her situation.
