**History:**

Min-Ji, a 24-year-old female university student hailing from Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with an unrelenting sense of despair since early 2022. Raised alongside her older brother in a family where her mother battled depression and her father managed hypertension, Min-Ji's childhood was marked by an insecure attachment to her mother, who was often emotionally unavailable due to her own struggles.

As a diligent student, Min-Ji poured herself into her studies, utilizing intellectualization as a means to cope with underlying emotional turmoil. Despite her academic success, she began to notice the light dimming from her life around January 2022. What started as subtle feelings of sadness evolved into a persistent depressed mood, accompanied by anhedonia that crept in a month later, stripping away the joy from activities she once cherished.

Throughout the past two years, Min-Ji attempted to navigate her way through the fog of her emotions, but the weight only grew heavier. By January 2024, her symptoms had intensified, prompting her to seek professional help. Her appearance remains well-groomed, a testament to her enduring effort to maintain normalcy, yet her minimal eye contact and slumped posture betray her inner struggle. Her speech is soft and slow-paced, mirroring her restricted affect and the linear, albeit sluggish, thought process preoccupied with worthlessness.

Min-Ji’s occasional alcohol use offers little respite, and she abstains from smoking. Currently on Sertraline 50mg daily, she demonstrates good insight into her condition but remains enveloped in a depressed mood. Her avoidance of peer relationships and reliance on repression and intellectualization as defense mechanisms illuminate her ongoing battle with her mental health.

Despite her cooperative demeanor, Min-Ji’s reserved attitude towards the examiner underscores the deep-seated insecurity and avoidance that have shaped her interactions. Her journey is one of resilience in the face of persistent mental health challenges, seeking to find light amid the shadows that have long clouded her path.
