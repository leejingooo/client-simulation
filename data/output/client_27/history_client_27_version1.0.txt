### History

Jin-hee, a 24-year-old female, has spent her entire life in the bustling city of Seoul, South Korea. Born into a middle-class family, she grew up with her parents and her older brother, who has always been her protector and confidant. Her mother, struggling with an anxiety disorder, often cast a shadow over the household, leaving Jin-hee to navigate her own emotional landscape largely on her own.

Jin-hee is currently a graduate student, a role that demands rigorous intellectual and emotional investment. Her academic journey has been marked by high achievement, but it has come at a significant personal cost. Since January 2022, she has been grappling with a persistent depressed mood and debilitating fatigue. These symptoms have recently intensified, particularly since mid-December 2023, making it difficult for her to maintain her usual levels of productivity and engagement.

Despite her struggles, Jin-hee maintains a well-groomed appearance and a cooperative demeanor. However, she often appears physically exhausted, a manifestation of psychomotor retardation. Her speech is soft and slow, reflecting her overall sense of lethargy and emotional burden. Her mood is predominantly depressed, and her affect is notably restricted.

Jin-hee's thought process, though goal-directed, is markedly slowed, and she is preoccupied with feelings of worthlessness and guilt. She does not experience hallucinations, illusions, or any form of depersonalization or derealization, and she has good insight into her condition. Importantly, she denies any suicidal ideation.

Her defense mechanisms include repression and isolation of affect, and she exhibits an insecure, anxious-preoccupied attachment style. Socially, she is an occasional smoker and a social drinker, but she has no history of substance abuse or dependency.

Jin-hee's story is one of resilience in the face of mounting psychological challenges. As she continues her academic pursuits, she is also on a journey to better understand and manage her mental health, drawing on her inner strength and the support of those around her.
