**History**

Jisoo Kim, a 24-year-old female university student from Seoul, South Korea, has been struggling with a persistently low mood since January 1, 2023. Born and raised in Seoul, she has always been a diligent student, balancing her academic responsibilities with familial expectations. Despite being well-groomed and maintaining a pleasant exterior, Jisoo has recently found it increasingly difficult to keep up appearances. Over the past month, her depressive symptoms have intensified, manifesting in a significant deterioration of her overall mood and energy levels.

The daughter of a mother who battles with depression and a father diagnosed with hypertension, Jisoo has long been familiar with the shadow of mental health issues. While she herself has no significant medical or neurological history, the confluence of her genetic predisposition and the pressures of university life seem to have exacerbated her current mental state. Her relationship with her family is marked by an anxious-preoccupied attachment, and she often feels a heavy burden to meet their expectations, especially as the eldest sibling and role model to her younger brother.

Starting around mid-January 2023, Jisoo began experiencing insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep and frequent awakenings. Despite her struggles, she remains a non-smoker and consumes alcohol only occasionally. In an attempt to manage her symptoms, she has been taking fluoxetine 20mg daily.

During her mental health evaluation, Jisoo appeared tired and exhibited psychomotor retardation. She was cooperative but reserved, making minimal eye contact and speaking in a soft, slow manner. Her mood was notably depressed, with a blunted affect. Her thought processes were slow, and she frequently expressed feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. Despite these challenges, she retained fair insight into her condition and did not exhibit suicidal ideation.

Jisoo's defense mechanisms, such as repression and isolation of affect, reflect her subconscious efforts to manage overwhelming emotions. Her insecure attachment style further complicates her ability to form stable, supportive relationships, which might have otherwise provided a buffer against her depressive symptoms. As she navigates this tumultuous period, Jisoo's story underscores the complex interplay between genetic vulnerability, environmental stressors, and individual psychological defenses.
