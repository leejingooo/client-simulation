**History**

Born and raised in the bustling city of Seoul, South Korea, a 24-year-old university student has been quietly battling the shadows of depression for the past two years. Living with her parents and a younger brother, she has always been seen as the responsible older sibling. However, beneath her composed exterior lies a world of emotional turmoil.

In January 2022, she first experienced a persistent low mood, which she initially attributed to academic pressures and the challenges of transitioning to university life. Despite her efforts to push through, the feelings of sadness and hopelessness lingered, gradually eroding her enthusiasm for activities she once enjoyed. By June of the same year, she began to lose interest in her favorite hobbies, a condition known as anhedonia, further isolating her from her social circles.

Her family, unaware of any history of psychiatric disorders and seeing no significant medical issues, remained oblivious to the depth of her struggles. While she occasionally consumed alcohol, she abstained from smoking and maintained a generally healthy lifestyle. The lack of overt symptoms and her ability to function on a superficial level masked the severity of her condition.

In recent weeks, her depressive symptoms have intensified, culminating in a noticeable change in her demeanor. She now appears older than her years, fatigued, and withdrawn, with a pronounced psychomotor retardation. Her speech has become soft, slow, and monotonous, reflecting her flat affect and impoverished thought processes. Feelings of worthlessness and guilt dominate her thoughts, though she has not exhibited suicidal ideation.

Her interactions reveal a cooperative yet minimally communicative attitude, hinting at her deep-seated struggles with insecure and avoidant attachment styles. Her defense mechanisms of repression and denial have only served to compound her sense of isolation and despair.

The university environment, once a place of learning and growth, now feels like a distant, oppressive burden. She remains trapped in a cycle of poor insight, unable to fully grasp or articulate the depth of her emotional pain. As she stands at the crossroads of her young adult life, her journey towards mental health recovery requires compassionate intervention and support to navigate the complexities of her inner world.
