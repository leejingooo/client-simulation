Kim Joon, a 21-year-old single male, has been grappling with severe mental health challenges. His journey began a year ago when he was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the young age of 20. Prior to this, Kim's life was relatively stable, though marked by a somewhat tumultuous family environment due to frequent arguments between his parents. His mother suffers from depression and his father has a history of alcohol abuse, factors that may have contributed to the stress in his household. Despite these challenges, his early development was normal, and he had a stable home, living with his parents and younger sister.

Kim's school years were difficult; he struggled academically and had few friends, often keeping to himself. His attempts at part-time work were unsuccessful, as his symptoms made it difficult to maintain employment. The recent move to a new city for university exacerbated his condition, triggering severe auditory hallucinations and paranoia. These symptoms have persisted for the past year and have intensified over the last eight months, particularly under stress and in crowded places.

Despite being compliant with his medication regimen, which partially alleviated his symptoms but caused weight gain, Kim continues to struggle. His current mental state is marked by a dysphoric mood, restricted affect, and decreased verbal productivity. He experiences a loosening of associations in his thought process and is preoccupied with his hallucinations. Though he is aware of his illness, he tends to externalize blame, further complicating his treatment.

Kim's suicidal ideation is a significant concern, although he has not formulated a plan or made an attempt. His insight into his condition is limited, and he continues to live with his family, who provide some level of support. Kimâ€™s story is one of ongoing struggle, marked by a challenging home environment, academic difficulties, and a relentless battle with severe mental illness.
