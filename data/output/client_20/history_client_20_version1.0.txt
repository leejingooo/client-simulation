Jiyoung Lee, a 24-year-old female university student from Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with a pervasive sense of sadness and disinterest over the past year. Born and raised in Seoul, she is the younger sibling of an older brother and remains single, focusing on her studies. Jiyoung's journey into higher education has been clouded by persistent depressive symptoms that began around January 2023. Despite slight improvements in her mood over the past month, her condition remains troubling.

Her struggles began with a deepening sense of worthlessness and hopelessness, gradually sapping her enthusiasm for previously enjoyed activities by February 2023. These feelings persisted despite her generally good physical health and absence of neurological issues. Currently, she manages her symptoms with SSRIs, although relief has been partial.

Jiyoung's family history reveals a backdrop of anxiety in her mother and hypertension in her father, possibly contributing to her condition. Socially, she drinks alcohol occasionally but does not smoke, which suggests a relatively healthy lifestyle otherwise.

In recent mental status examinations, Jiyoung appears well-groomed and cooperative but visibly fatigued. Her speech is notably slow and soft, reflecting her depressed mood and restricted affect. Although she remains goal-directed in thought, her processing speed has noticeably slowed, and her thoughts often center on themes of worthlessness and hopelessness. Despite these challenges, she maintains good insight into her condition and exhibits no suicidal ideation.

Psychodynamically, Jiyoung employs defense mechanisms such as repression and denial, which may be exacerbating her anxieties. Her attachment style is anxious-preoccupied and insecure, indicating underlying fears of abandonment and self-doubt.

Through her reserved yet engaged demeanor, Jiyoung navigates her academic responsibilities while battling the shadows of depression, striving for a semblance of normalcy in her young life.
