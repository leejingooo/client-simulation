Jane Doe, a 40-year-old single woman, has spent her life grappling with the shadows of her past and the pressures of her present. Growing up in a stable yet emotionally distant household, she was the middle child among two siblings. Her father battled alcohol abuse, and her mother, who had bipolar disorder, cast a long shadow over Jane's formative years. Despite a few close friendships, she was generally introverted and struggled academically, often feeling overshadowed by her siblings.

Jane pursued a career in accounting, driven by a desire for stability. Her professional life has been marked by high performance but marred by strained relationships with her supervisor and colleagues, leading to an increasingly stressful work environment. This stress compounded her already fragile mental health, triggering a recurrence of her major depressive disorder, initially diagnosed at age 35. She had sought help through medication, which was only partially effective and caused weight gain, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which proved beneficial but was discontinued due to financial constraints.

Over the past 20 months, Jane's depression has deepened, exacerbated by a lack of social support and increasing isolation. She feels perpetually sad and has lost interest in activities she once enjoyed. Fatigue is a constant companion, only slightly alleviated by rest but worsened by her demanding workload. Her mental health examination reveals a depressed mood, restricted affect, and a thought process characterized by circumstantiality and rumination. Despite being alert and oriented, she struggles with concentration and general information recall, and her suicidal ideation poses a moderate risk.

Jane's intellectual insight into her condition is clear, yet she remains trapped in a cycle of sadness and fatigue, yearning for a way to break free but hindered by the very circumstances she seeks to escape.
