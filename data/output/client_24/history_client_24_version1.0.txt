**History:**

Eun-Ji, a 24-year-old university student from Seoul, South Korea, has been navigating the complexities of life with increasing difficulty over the past two years. Growing up in a loving but emotionally restrained household, Eun-Ji always felt a latent pressure to excel, especially since her older brother seemed to effortlessly meet and exceed familial expectations. Her mother, who has a history of major depressive disorder, often mirrored Eun-Ji’s own struggles, creating an unspoken bond of shared pain between them.

In January 2022, Eun-Ji first began experiencing a pervasive sense of sadness that she couldn't shake off. By March of the same year, the joy she once found in activities she loved faded, leaving her feeling empty and disconnected. Despite these growing concerns, she continued to push through, dedicating herself to her studies and social obligations, though the effort left her increasingly fatigued.

The turning point came in mid-November 2023 when her symptoms intensified, leading her to seek medical help. She was prescribed SSRIs in December 2023, but the path to improvement has been slow. Socially, she indulges in occasional alcohol use but has always refrained from smoking, perhaps as a way to maintain some control over her life.

When she finally sought psychiatric help, Eun-Ji presented as a young woman weighed down by her own mind. Her speech was slow and low in volume, and her mood was palpably depressed. She exhibited psychomotor retardation, appearing fatigued and struggling to muster the energy for daily tasks. Despite her open attitude towards the examiner, she was somewhat reserved, reflecting her fearful-avoidant attachment style.

Eun-Ji’s thought processes were linear but sluggish, dominated by feelings of worthlessness and guilt. Though she did not experience hallucinations or illusions, her insight was partial—she acknowledged her symptoms but often minimized their impact. The most concerning aspect of her mental state was her suicidal ideation, a distressing revelation that underscored the severity of her condition.

In coping with her internal turmoil, Eun-Ji often resorted to denial and intellectualization, distancing herself from the emotional weight of her experiences. Her insecure attachment style added another layer of complexity to her struggles, making her reluctant to seek support even when she needed it most.

As she navigates this challenging period, Eun-Ji remains a figure of resilience, striving to find a balance between her academic responsibilities and her mental well-being. Her journey is a testament to the silent battles fought by many, highlighting the importance of understanding, empathy, and professional support in the face of mental illness.
