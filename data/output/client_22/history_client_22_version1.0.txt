**History:**

Minji Kim, a 24-year-old university student residing in Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with an overwhelming sense of sorrow and fatigue that began to surface at the start of 2023. Born and raised in Seoul, Minji is the eldest child, with a younger brother who she has always felt responsible for. As a diligent student, she has always strived for academic excellence, often pushing herself to the limit.

The initial signs of her struggle appeared subtly after the New Year of 2023. Minji started feeling persistently low and devoid of energy. By March, fatigue had woven into her daily life, making even simple tasks feel insurmountable. Her once-vibrant social life dwindled, and she found herself withdrawing from friends and family.

Despite having no significant medical or neurological history and abstaining from substance abuse, Minji's mental health began to deteriorate. Her mother, who has a history of anxiety disorder, has always been a silent shadow in Minji’s mind, possibly contributing to Minji's own anxieties and fears.

During a recent mental status examination, Minji presented as neatly dressed but visibly tired. Though cooperative, she was subdued and displayed signs of psychomotor retardation. Her speech was soft and slow, mirroring her depressed mood and flat affect. Minji's thought process was sluggish, and her thoughts were marred by feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. She exhibited limited insight into her condition, though she denied any suicidal ideation.

Psychodynamically, Minji appears to employ defense mechanisms such as repression and denial, possibly as coping strategies to manage her deep-seated anxieties. Her attachment style is anxious, struggling to trust others, which might stem from her family dynamics and the pressure she feels as the older sibling.

Minji’s journey through the past year has been a silent battle, one where she has tried to maintain her academic responsibilities while quietly crumbling under the weight of her emotional burdens. With appropriate support and intervention, there is hope for Minji to reclaim her sense of self and well-being.
