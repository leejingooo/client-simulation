Jin-ah Lee, a 24-year-old university student from Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with a persistent and debilitating depression for the past year. Despite her intelligence and dedication to her studies, Jin-ah found herself slipping into a deepening malaise around the start of 2023. Her once vibrant life, filled with academic pursuits and social activities, began to lose its color. She no longer found joy in her hobbies or the company of her friends, a stark contrast to her previous enthusiastic and engaged self.

Growing up with a younger brother in a bustling city, Jin-ah was always seen as the responsible and ambitious one. However, the shadow of her mother's depression loomed over her childhood, subtly shaping her own emotional world. Her mother's struggles and Jin-ah's subsequent insecure and avoidant attachment styles left her ill-equipped to navigate her burgeoning mental health issues.

By December 2023, Jin-ah's condition had noticeably worsened. Her appearance became disheveled, her movements lethargic, and she increasingly withdrew from those around her. Her speech, once lively and engaging, turned soft, slow, and monotonous, mirroring her blunted affect and pervasive negative thoughts. She struggled with feelings of hopelessness and had limited insight into her condition, often resorting to repression and isolation of affect as defense mechanisms.

Despite her cooperative nature during examinations, Jin-ah's limited eye contact and reserved demeanor spoke volumes about her internal turmoil. Her psychomotor retardation and suicidal ideation were alarming indicators of her severe depressive state. Jin-ah's occasional social drinking and non-smoking habits provided no solace, and her lack of significant medical, neurological, or substance abuse history suggested that her depression was more deeply rooted in her psychological and familial background.

Jin-ah's journey is a poignant reminder of the profound impact of mental health issues and the importance of early intervention and support. As she navigates this challenging period, her story underscores the need for compassionate and comprehensive psychiatric care to help her reclaim her sense of self and joy in life.
