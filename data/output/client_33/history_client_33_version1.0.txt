**History:**

Min-Ji Kim, a 24-year-old graduate student from Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with a persistent depressive mood and an overwhelming loss of interest in her daily activities. These symptoms first surfaced in May 2022, and after an initial period of struggle, they seemed to subside somewhat, only to resurge vehemently around mid-December 2023. The cumulative burden of these symptoms has taken a toll on her for over a year and a half.

Min-Ji's family background is marked by her mother's history of depression, which may have predisposed her to similar struggles. Raised in a traditional South Korean household, Min-Ji was always considered the studious and diligent child, a trait that earned her a place in a reputable graduate program. However, the pressure to excel academically and the isolation inherent in her studies have compounded her emotional struggles.

Her older brother, a figure she often looked up to, moved abroad for work, leaving her feeling somewhat isolated. Despite being well-groomed and appearing her age, Min-Ji presents a fa√ßade of composure that belies her inner turmoil. She is cooperative and engaged during consultations but exhibits signs of fatigue and psychomotor retardation.

Min-Ji's speech is soft-spoken, and while her thought process remains logical, it is notably slowed, often shadowed by themes of hopelessness and self-doubt. Her affect is restricted, and she admits to feeling perpetually depressed, though she retains good insight into her condition. Importantly, she denies any suicidal ideation.

Currently on Sertraline 50mg daily, Min-Ji maintains a relatively healthy lifestyle, abstaining from smoking and only drinking alcohol occasionally on weekends. Her coping mechanisms include repression and intellectualization, often oscillating between anxious-preoccupied and fearful-avoidant attachment styles.

Min-Ji's story is one of a young woman caught in the throes of depression, struggling to balance the expectations of her cultural and academic environment with her mental health needs. Despite her challenges, her engagement in therapy and good insight offer a hopeful path towards recovery.
