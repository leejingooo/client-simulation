**History:**

Yuna Kim, a 24-year-old university student from Seoul, South Korea, has been grappling with a persistent sense of despair for the past year. Born and raised in Seoul, Yuna is the younger of two siblings, with an older brother who has always been her confidant and protector. Despite a loving family, Yuna's emotional turmoil has roots that dig deep into her adolescence. Her mother, who has a history of depression, often cast a shadow over the household with her unpredictable moods, while her father, though supportive, struggled with hypertension and was frequently preoccupied with his health.

Yuna's battle with depression began to surface on January 1, 2023, manifesting as a pervasive and unshakable sadness. By February, she found herself unable to enjoy activities that once brought her joy, a condition known as anhedonia. This was soon followed by insomnia in March, where sleepless nights became a cruel companion, further draining her already sapped energy.

Academically accomplished and socially active, Yuna's demeanor began to shift. Friends noticed she was more reserved, her once vibrant presence now marked by a blunted affect and a soft, low-volume speech. Despite being well-groomed, her tired eyes and slowed psychomotor activity betrayed the internal struggle she faced daily. Yuna's thoughts often revolved around feelings of worthlessness, yet she remained guarded, polite, and cooperative during interactions, though her insight into her condition was limited.

Her coping mechanisms leaned heavily on repression and isolation of affect, reflecting her fearful-avoidant attachment style. She occasionally turned to alcohol but avoided smoking and drugs, maintaining a relatively healthy lifestyle otherwise. The psychological burden, however, has been immense, leading her to a point where professional intervention became necessary.

Yuna's story is one of quiet resilience, battling internal demons while maintaining external appearances. Her journey through the labyrinth of depression, influenced by familial patterns and personal struggles, underscores the complexity of her mental health landscape.
