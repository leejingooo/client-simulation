Jeong Eun-ji, a 24-year-old student from Seoul, South Korea, has been struggling with a depressed mood since the beginning of 2023. The youngest of two siblings, she lives with her parents and an older brother. Her mother had a history of depression which might have influenced Eun-ji's own mental health struggles. Throughout her childhood, she was described as a diligent and bright student, but over the past year, her spark has dimmed.

Eun-ji's symptoms began subtly but have gradually taken over her life. By mid-February, she found herself losing interest in activities she once enjoyed, a condition known as anhedonia. Despite her efforts to maintain her academic performance, her motivation waned, and she struggled to find joy in her studies and social interactions.

March brought a new challenge: insomnia. Initially, she brushed it off as stress from her coursework, but the inability to sleep and the fatigue that followed became persistent. Over the past two weeks, her sleep issues have worsened, exacerbating her feelings of exhaustion and hopelessness.

Her family has been supportive, but Eun-ji's reluctance to share her deeper struggles, possibly due to the defense mechanisms of denial and repression, has kept her isolated. Her occasional use of alcohol is her only vice; she does not smoke or use drugs. Despite her suffering, she remains cooperative and open during consultations, showing good insight into her condition.

Eun-ji's mental status examination revealed a well-groomed appearance but noticeable fatigue. Her speech is soft and slow, with a blunted affect and a depressed mood. Though her thought processes remain goal-directed, they are notably slow, reflecting her psychomotor retardation. She denies any hallucinations, illusions, or suicidal ideations, maintaining a good level of insight into her condition.

Eun-ji's attachment style is a mix of secure and anxious-preoccupied, which might stem from her close-knit family environment and her mother's history of depression. She is currently navigating her way through this challenging period, seeking help to reclaim the vibrant life she once knew.
