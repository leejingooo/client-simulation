**History:**

Hana Lee, a 24-year-old university student from Seoul, South Korea, presents with a year-long history of persistent daily depression and fatigue. Born and raised in Seoul, she is the elder sibling to a younger brother. Although her childhood was generally stable, her family history casts a shadow; her mother has struggled with depression, and her father battles hypertension.

Hana's journey through adolescence and young adulthood seemed typical until the start of 2023, when a pervasive sense of sadness began to envelop her. As a diligent student, she initially attributed her fatigue and low mood to academic pressures. However, as the months progressed, her symptoms became unrelenting, affecting her daily functioning and relationships.

Despite being well-groomed and maintaining a cooperative demeanor, Hana's psychomotor retardation and slow responses reveal the depth of her struggle. Her speech is soft and lacks energy, mirroring her restricted affect and pervasive feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness. She often finds herself in a state of denial and repression, defense mechanisms that enable her to navigate day-to-day life, albeit with difficulty.

Living at home with her family, Hana's occasional use of alcohol serves as a minor escape, though she is a non-smoker. She has no significant medical or neurological history, and her only current medication is Sertraline, prescribed to manage her depressive symptoms. Her insight into her condition is partial; she recognizes her struggles but often feels trapped by them.

Hana's attachment style is insecure and fearful-avoidant, likely influencing her interactions and relationships. Her mental health has been a growing concern, and despite her partial insight, she has not exhibited suicidal ideation. Her journey is one of resilience amidst adversity, seeking a path to recovery and understanding in the face of her mental health challenges.
