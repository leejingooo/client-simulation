**History**

Eun-Ji Kim, a 40-year-old marketing manager from Busan, South Korea, has been navigating a challenging life journey marked by persistent emotional turbulence. Born in Seoul and raised alongside her older brother, Eun-Ji's childhood was colored by the shadows of her father's battle with depression and her mother's ongoing struggle with hypertension. These familial health issues left an indelible mark on Eun-Ji, fostering an early sense of insecurity and ambivalence in her attachments.

Eun-Ji's professional life has been a series of accomplishments, yet her personal life tells a different story. Despite her successes, she has never married, a decision influenced perhaps by her deep-seated fears of emotional vulnerability and rejection. Her role as a marketing manager requires a high level of creativity and interaction, which has become increasingly difficult for her to maintain.

In February 2022, Eun-Ji first experienced a profound depressive episode characterized by a pervasive sense of sadness and a loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed. This episode subsided but re-emerged with greater intensity in December 2023, lasting for the past four weeks. She reports feeling an overwhelming sense of worthlessness and guilt, which has significantly hampered her psychomotor activity. Her speech has slowed, and she often pauses mid-sentence, struggling to articulate her thoughts. 

Her social habits include occasional alcohol use but she is a non-smoker. Medically, she manages her hypertension with Lisinopril. Despite being well-groomed, Eun-Ji appears older than her age, a physical manifestation of her internal struggles. Her demeanor is withdrawn; she avoids eye contact and presents with a blunted affect. During mental status examinations, she cooperates but remains reserved, revealing only limited insight into her condition.

Eun-Ji's defense mechanisms, primarily repression and denial, coupled with her insecure and ambivalent attachment style, have compounded her difficulties. Her father's depression haunts her, a ghost she can't seem to exorcise, and her mother's hypertension is a constant reminder of the fragility of health. While she has no history of neurological issues and denies suicidal ideation, the weight of her psychological burdens remains heavy.

In summary, Eun-Ji's life story is one of resilience amid persistent emotional challenges. Her journey is a testament to the complex interplay of genetic predisposition, personal experiences, and psychological defenses that shape an individual's mental health.
