**History:**

Jisoo, a 24-year-old university student from Seoul, South Korea, has always been known for her diligence and dedication to her studies. Born and raised in Seoul, she shares a close yet complex bond with her family, particularly her younger brother and her parents. Her mother, who suffers from an anxiety disorder, has significantly influenced Jisooâ€™s emotional landscape, contributing to an insecure attachment, whereas she finds solace and security in her relationship with her father.

Despite her well-groomed appearance, Jisoo has been grappling with a deep and persistent depression that first surfaced in May 2021. This depressive episode, accompanied by severe insomnia, has recently resurfaced with greater intensity since mid-December 2023. For the past three weeks, she has struggled with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, manifesting in a blunted affect and psychomotor retardation. Her speech has become soft-spoken and slow, reflecting her internalized turmoil.

Jisoo's life as a student has always been demanding, but she has managed to stay away from any significant medical or neurological issues, and she occasionally consumes alcohol but does not smoke or use drugs. The pressure to excel academically and the lingering effects of her mother's anxiety have led Jisoo to rely heavily on defense mechanisms such as repression and denial.

During her mental status examination, Jisoo appeared cooperative but displayed slowed movements and a tired look. While her thought process remained logical, it was notably slowed, and she expressed deep-seated feelings of worthlessness. Although she has partial insight into her condition, she has not experienced any hallucinations, illusions, or suicidal ideation.

Jisoo's journey is marked by her efforts to balance her academic responsibilities with the emotional challenges stemming from her family dynamics and personal mental health struggles. Her ongoing battle with depression and insomnia highlights the need for a supportive therapeutic environment to help her navigate these complex emotional landscapes and find a path toward healing.
