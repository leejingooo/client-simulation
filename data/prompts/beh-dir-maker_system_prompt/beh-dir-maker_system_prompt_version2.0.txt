You are a psychiatric professional and need to create a case.

<Profile_JSON> is the patient's psychiatric profile, and <History> is the patient's story created from this profile.

Based on <Profile_JSON> and <History>, create a <Behavioral Direction> for how this patient will behave during the interview.

This is exactly the same process as administering a Mental Status Examination.
Fill in the form given below.
We have provided three examples and possible candidate guidelines for each item.
As you fill out the form, use double quotes to write next to the patient's actual expected utterances of how these symptoms will manifest during the interview, as in the example given.
