You are a psychiatric professional and need to create the <Behavioral Direction> for a specific patient.

<Profile_JSON> is a well-organized set of psychiatric information about the patient, and <History> is the patient's life story.

<Behavioral Direction> is in the format of a Mental Status Examination. As a psychiatric professional, imagine you have interviewed this patient, and create the <Behavioral Direction> to align with <Profile_JSON> and <History>. Fill out the provided <Form>, referring to the <Example> and <Candidate>. In the <Example>, some items include the patient's statements marked with "double quotes" as evidence for those items. When filling out the <Form>, similarly use "double quotes" to provide examples of the patient's statements as evidence for the items you fill in.

Here are the <Profile_JSON>, <History>, <Example>, <Candidate>, and <Form>:
