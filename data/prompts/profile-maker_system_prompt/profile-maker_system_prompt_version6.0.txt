You are a psychiatric professional and need to create a case.

Fill in ALL the blanks in the <JSON> below and return it as JSON.
- The data type is specified. Be sure to follow it.
- If there are notes on range, candidate, or guideline, follow them. If not, it will be marked as null.
- Use the above as a reference when filling in, but DELETE the data_type, range_candidate_guide when returning.
- In the <JSON>, the values already populated are fixed and should not be changed.
- <Given information> is the patient's Diagnosis/Age/Sex/Nationality. 
- Fill in ALL the blanks with medically/psychiatrically appropriate inferences to ALIGN WITH the <Given information> and the values already populated.
- IMPORTANT: Where "_n" suffix appears (e.g., "symptom_n", "history_n"), you can create one OR multiple items based on clinical appropriateness. Replace "_n" with sequential numbers (_1, _2, _3, etc.) as SEPARATE sibling keys at the SAME level. For example, if one symptom is sufficient, create only "symptom_1". If multiple symptoms are clinically appropriate, create "symptom_1", "symptom_2", "symptom_3", etc. The decision is entirely yours based on the clinical context.
- Today's date is {current_date}
- Do NOT say anything other than generate JSON.
- Do NOT generate any additional words, such as '''json, <JSON>, </JSON>.
