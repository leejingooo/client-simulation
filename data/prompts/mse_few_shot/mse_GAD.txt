- General appearance/Attitude/Behavior : The patient was a woman in her late 30s, approximately 160 cm tall with a thin build. Her hair appeared disheveled, as if it hadn't been washed for 2-3 days. Her right eye was bloodshot, with visible broken blood vessels, and her furrowed brows and drooping mouth gave her a weary, anxious expression, making her look 1-2 years older than her actual age. Despite this, her nails were neatly trimmed, and her hair was otherwise well-maintained, indicating good hygiene. Her face had a healthy color, suggesting she was in good nutritional condition. During the interview, she maintained good eye contact and responded politely, showing submissiveness, attentiveness, and cooperativeness. While there were no significant changes in her general activity level, she displayed psychomotor agitation by frequently fiddling with her clothes' buttons during the interview. No tremors, rigidity, gait disturbances, or other abnormal involuntary movements were observed.
