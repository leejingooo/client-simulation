<History>
Jane Kim, a 24-year-old graphic designer from Seoul, South Korea, grew up in a bustling urban environment with her parents and older brother. Despite being a talented and creative individual, Jane's life has been marred by periods of deep emotional struggle. Her motherâ€™s long-standing battle with anxiety had a profound influence on Jane, often taking a toll on her mental well-being. Jane always felt the need to be the "stable" one in the family, which led her to repress her own feelings and hardships.

In June 2021, after a stressful period at work and the isolation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, Jane first experienced a significant depressive episode marked by overwhelming sadness and a loss of interest in activities she once enjoyed. Though she sought temporary relief from SSRIs, her symptoms of depression and anhedonia re-emerged forcefully in September 2023, leading her to seek help once again. She reports feeling persistently fatigued, struggling to derive pleasure even from her favorite hobby of digital illustration.

Socially, Jane tends to keep to herself, partly due to her insecure and fearful-avoidant attachment style. Despite casual alcohol consumption, she is a non-smoker and has no history of substance abuse. Her relationships are few and far between, often hampered by her tendency to withdraw and deny her vulnerabilities. These defense mechanisms further complicate her ability to engage meaningfully with others, leaving her feeling isolated and disconnected.

Jane remains professionally functional but admits that her pace and motivation have significantly dwindled. During our sessions, she presented as well-groomed yet visibly tired. Her speech was soft and slow, her affect blunted, and her thought processes linear but sluggish, centering around feelings of worthlessness. Despite having some insight into her condition, she continues to grapple with partial denial.

Her father's hypertension and her mother's anxiety loom over her, adding layers of stress. Nonetheless, Jane displays no suicidal ideation, providing a crucial window for intervention. With partial insight and a willingness to cooperate, Jane expresses a desire to reclaim her sense of joy and purpose, a glimmer of hope in her otherwise bleak mental state.
