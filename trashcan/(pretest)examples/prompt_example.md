<History>
Sarah, a 24-year-old female, originally from New York, now resides in Boston where she is pursuing her graduate studies. Despite her academic achievements, Sarah has been grappling with a persistent depressed mood and anhedonia. These symptoms initially surfaced in January 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they have recently re-emerged with greater intensity since August 2023, persisting for the past 12 weeks.

Sarah's family history is significant for mental health issues, with her mother having a history of depression. Her father, while not having a psychiatric history, deals with hypertension. Sarah has one older brother with whom she shares a close but somewhat distant relationship, reflective of her avoidant attachment style. This familial backdrop likely influences her own struggles with mental health.

Academically driven, Sarah has always been a high achiever, but the pressures of graduate school have exacerbated her symptoms. She has been on Fluoxetine 20 mg daily, which offers some relief, but her depressive episodes have made it challenging to maintain her usual level of productivity and social engagement.

Sarah's social history reveals occasional alcohol use, but she has never smoked or used other substances. Her mental status examination paints a picture of a young woman who is cooperative yet visibly fatigued, with psychomotor retardation evident. Her speech is soft and slow, her mood is undeniably depressed, and her affect is blunted. Despite these challenges, Sarah retains good insight into her condition and does not exhibit suicidal ideation.

Her thought processes remain linear, albeit slow, and she often expresses feelings of worthlessness. Defense mechanisms such as suppression and intellectualization are prominent, likely serving as coping strategies to manage her internal turmoil. Sarah's engagement with her examiner, though subdued, indicates a willingness to address her issues, even as her insecure and avoidant attachment styles complicate her interpersonal relationships.

Overall, Sarah's history reveals a complex interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental stressors, and psychological factors contributing to her current mental state. Her journey underscores the importance of a supportive therapeutic environment to navigate these multifaceted challenges.
